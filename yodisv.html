        <h1 style="color: orange;">Extra Costs</h1>

           <p> Maybe you have to invest in the virtualization software and possibly additional hardware
            might be required to make the virtualization possible. This depends on your existing
            network. Many businesses have sufficient capacity to accommodate the virtualization
            without requiring much cash. If you have an infrastructure that is more than five years
            old, you have to consider an initial renewal budget. </p> 
           <h1 style="color: orange;">Software Licensing</h1>

           <p>This is becoming less of a problem as more software vendors adapt to the increased
            adoption of virtualization. However, it is important to check with your vendors to
            understand how they view software use in a virtualized environment.</p> 
          <h1 style="color: orange;">Learn the new Infrastructure</h1>

           <p> Implementing and managing a virtualized environment will require IT staff with expertise
            in virtualization. On the user side, a typical virtual environment will operate similarly to
            the non-virtual environment. There are some applications that do not adapt well to the
            virtualized environment.
