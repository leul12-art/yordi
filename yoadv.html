        <h1 style="color:orange">Using Virtualization for Efficient Hardware Utilization</h1>

           <p>Virtualization decreases costs by reducing the <mark>need for physical hardware systems</mark> . Virtual
            machines use efficient hardware, which lowers the quantities of hardware, associated
            maintenance costs and reduces the power along with cooling the demand. You can allocate
            memory, space and CPU in just a second, making you more self-independent from
            hardware vendors.</p> 
           <h1 style="color: orange;">Using Virtualization to Increase Availability</h1> 

           <p>Virtualization platforms offer a number of advanced features that are not found on physical
            servers,<mark>which increase uptime and availability</mark> . Although the vendor feature names may
            be different, they usually offer capabilities such as live migration, storage migration, fault
            tolerance, high availability and distributed resource scheduling. These technologies keep
            virtual machines chugging along or give them the ability to recover from unplanned
            outages.
            The ability to move a virtual machine from one server to another is perhaps one of the
            greatest single benefits of virtualization with far reaching uses. As the technology
            continues to mature to the point where it can do long-distance migrations, such as being
            able to move a virtual machine from one data center to another no matter the network
            latency involved. </p> 
            
          <h1 style="color: orange;"> Disaster Recovery</h1> 
           
          <p> Disaster recovery is very easy when your servers are virtualized. With up-to-date

            snapshots of your virtual machines, you can quickly get back up and running. An
            organization can more easily create an affordable replication site. If a disaster strikes in
            the data center or server room itself, you can always move those virtual machines
            elsewhere into a cloud provider. Having that level of flexibility means your disaster
            recovery plan will be easier to enact and will have a 99% success rate.
