        <p1>Client virtualization also called as <strong>VDI</strong> runs the entire desktop environment within a
            centralized server. All processing is done within the server. Client devices are typically thin
            clients that serve as an end node to connect I/O peripherals such as keyboard, mouse, a
            display, audio connectors and even USB ports over the LAN.</p1>

           <p> As discussed earlier, a thin client hardware is a computer terminal, which provides I/O for
            a keyboard, mouse, monitor, jacks for sound peripherals, and open ports for USB devices.
            For example â€“ Printer, Flash Drive, Web Cam, Card Reader, Smartphone, etc. Some thin
           clients include legacy serial and/or parallel ports to support older devices such as Receipt
           Printers, Scales, Time Clocks, etc. Thin client software typically consists of a GUI (graphical user interface), Cloud Access Agents (for e.g., RDP, ICA, PCoIP), a local web browser,
           terminal emulations (in some cases) and a basic set of local utilities.
